# BEE2-items-TheDarkBomber-Contributions
My contributions of items and styles to BEE2.4.

### Current Projects

*No projects are currently in progress.*

### Finished Projects

* Extra Fizzlers - Adds the Physics Repulsion Field and Closed Solid Field.

### Cancelled Projects

* Blue Portals Items and Style - Adds the items and style from the Blue Portals mod for Portal 1. This wasn't actually cancelled, but was moved to the [``blue_portals`` branch](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/tree/blue_portals) on the main BEE2-items repro.
